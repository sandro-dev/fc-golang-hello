- The final image is less than 2Mb of size (1.81Mb)
- The container prints the message and exit
- The image was published on [DockerHub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sandrodev/golang-hello) 

### Built With
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)


## How To Use

To download and run this container application, you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and an account in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). From your command line:

```bash
# Download the image to run a container from docker hub
# and prints the message "Full Cycle Rocks!"
$ docker run sandrodev/golang-hello

# Verify the image size
$ docker image

# Verify the containers running
